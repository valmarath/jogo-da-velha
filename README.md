Jogo da Velha (Hash Game) is a project made alongside my course in [B7Web](https://b7web.com.br/fullstack/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-7eYj5vT-QIVEz6RCh2VfgXQEAAYASAAEgJfifD_BwE&ref=I24108426I) in order to practice JavaScript. It's a digital representation of the classic hash game.

- To play it, just click the position you want to mark in your given turn until the "X" or "O" player win. You can reset the game by clicking on "Resetar". 

- To understand exactly how the script works and to test some of the features proposed, see the [script.js](https://github.com/valmarath/jogo-da-velha/blob/main/script.js).
